    <h1>Alan Turing</h1>
    <p>The famed code-breaking war hero, now considered the father of computer science and artificial intelligence, was
      criminally convicted and harshly treated under the U.K.'s homophobic laws.</p>

      <p>Alan Turing was a brilliant British mathematician who took a leading role in breaking Nazi ciphers during WWII.
        In his seminal 1936 paper, he proved that there cannot exist any universal algorithmic method of determining
        truth in mathematics, and that mathematics will always contain undecidable propositions. His work is widely
        acknowledged as foundational research of computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>English scientist Alan Turing was born Alan Mathison Turing on June 23, 1912, in Maida Vale, London, England.
        At a young age, he displayed signs of high intelligence, which some of his teachers recognized, but did not
        necessarily respect. When Turing attended the well-known independent Sherborne School at the age of 13, he
        became particularly interested in math and science.</p>
      <p>After Sherborne, Turing enrolled at King's College (University of Cambridge) in Cambridge, England, studying
        there from 1931 to 1934. As a result of his dissertation, in which he proved the central limit theorem, Turing
        was elected a fellow at the school upon his graduation.

        In 1936, Turing delivered a paper, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem," in
        which he presented the notion of a universal machine (later called the “Universal Turing Machine," and then the
        "Turing machine") capable of computing anything that is computable: It is considered the precursor to the modern
        computer.

        Over the next two years, Turing studied mathematics and cryptology at the Institute for Advanced Study in
        Princeton, New Jersey. After receiving his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1938, he returned to Cambridge,
        and then took a part-time position with the Government Code and Cypher School, a British code-breaking
        organization.</p>

  <h1>What is Computing?</h1>
  <p>The first million years of hominid history produced tools to amplify, and later
    mechanize, our physical abilities to enable us to move faster, reach higher, and
    hit harder. We have developed tools that amplify physical force by the trillions
    and increase the speeds at which we can travel by the thousand.s
    Tools that amplify intellectual abilities are much rarer. While some animals have
    developed tools to amplify their physical abilities, only humans have developed
    tools to substantially amplify our intellectual abilities and it is those advances
    that have enabled humans to dominate the planet. The first key intellect amplifier was language. Language provided
    the ability to transmit our thoughts to
    others, as well as to use our own minds more effectively. The next key intellect
    amplifier was writing, which enabled the storage and transmission of thoughts
    over time and distance.
    Computing is the ultimate mental amplifier—computers can mechanize any intellectual activity we can imagine.
    Automatic computing radically changes how
    humans solve problems, and even the kinds of problems we can imagine solving. Computing has changed the world more
    than any other invention of the
    past hundred years, and has come to pervade nearly all human endeavors. Yet,
    we are just at the beginning of the computing revolution; today’s computing offers just a glimpse of the potential
    impact of computing.</p>
